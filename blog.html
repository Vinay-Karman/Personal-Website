                It was on the 5th of July that I set foot on the campus of IISc. We had our counseling scheduled for that day. The weather was cloudy and a bit rainy. My father and I arrived at the campus around 9 o'clock.

                Our first challenge was finding the Sathish Dhawan Auditorium, where the main commencement was going to take place. With some help from the security guards, we finally reached our destination. After completing some paperwork, I entered the auditorium. There, we received a warm welcome from the Director of IISc, followed by speeches from the Dean and various professors. They explained the course structure, often comparing it to that of IIT Bombay.

                After the informative session, we were given a tour of the campus by our seniors. They showed us various departments and the iconic main building. Following the brief tour, we had lunch. The meal was delicious, and I naively thought the mess food would be equally good (I was mistaken).

                After lunch, I roamed around the campus a bit more before we left to catch our train home. During the counseling session, I spoke with some other students.
                 <br> <br>
                The first person I met was Keval Pithadhya from Gujarat. I also met two interesting guys. One was a student from Uttar Pradesh (I forgot his name). In the end, he joined IIT Kanpur. He told me that he had been preparing for JEE Advanced since 6th grade and now just wanted to play Call of Duty. The other was named Vaibhav Mahore. I would describe his personality as a 'blowhard' and a 'narcissist'.

                Afterward, I made many more friends when some guys created a WhatsApp group. This marked the beginning of my journey at IISc, filled with new experiences and connections.

            <h3>My Journey from 10th to 12th: From Average Student to Aspirant</h3>
            <p class="author">Author: Vinay Karman </p>
            <p class="posted">Posted: 24 June 2024 </p>
            <p class="content">
                In April 2021, my parents were searching for a school for my 11th and 12th studies since my previous school only went up to the 10th standard. After some consideration, they decided to enroll me in Career Academy in Nahan, in the Non-Medical stream. When I transitioned from the 10th to the 11th grade, I was an average student academically. You might laugh, but initially, I hadn't even heard about competitive exams like JEE or NEET. All I knew about was the NDA exam. I was so passionate about joining the army that I took the Sainik School exam in the 8th grade and started exercising to get physically fit for the exams. Luckily, my father choose to admit me to the competition batch (for JEE and NEET exams), where I learned about these exams.  When I googled them, my first reaction was, "Who the heck takes these ridiculous tough exams just for college admission?" I thought college admissions were like school admissions EASY!. Never in my wildest dreams did I think about preparing for these exams. But some circumstances led me to start preparing for JEE.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                When I began my JEE preparation, I was literally 'DUMB'. I didn't even know the discriminant formula and didn't realize it was taught in the 10th standard (I spent the year playing games!). My coaching classes were held online on Teams, making it hard to understand the concepts, and the coaching was terrible except for the math teacher (who I later found out had passed away recently due to cardiac arrest). A friend suggested a YouTube video on differentiation by Alakh Pandey. This introduced me to the open-source way of learning through YouTube. From then on, I watched Physics Wallah (PW) videos to cover theory. That's how I started preparing for JEE. During my prep time, I had my ups and downs, like any other student. I learned physics from YouTube and math from my teacher. However, I struggled with chemistry as I couldn't find any good YouTube teachers for it. As a result, my chemistry was weak in 11th grade. In the blink of an eye, 11th grade was over, and it was time for the final year, 12th standard. I initially thought of leaving the competition program as it was wasting my prep time, but I decided to stay because of the math teacher. I also saw it as a way to stay focused and not get distracted, as I would have to join the standard batch where they taught for boards.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Starting 12th standard, the coaching teachers weren't taking our classes, and board teachers took over instead. My classmates and I were so furious about this that we united to raise our voices. The situation was so bad that one girl from our batch decided to leave the school after paying the non-refundable fees. After some resistance from our side, they started taking our classes regularly. One thing I forgot to mention was that our coaching offered courses for both NEET and JEE, but our common subject classes were combined. This had its own consequences for both JEE and NEET students. Seeing all this chaos, I purchased the PW Lakshya JEE course and started studying from it regularly. I would go to class at 9 AM, come back home around 2/3 PM, and then start my online lectures from 4 to 9 PM. That was my schedule for 12th standard. Luckily, for chemistry, a teacher named Siddharth Kirti joined the coaching, and he was fabulous. He saved my chemistry from becoming a Titanic disaster. Siddharth sir was so dedicated to teaching us that he even held classes on Sundays at our request. The previous chemistry teacher hadn't completed the syllabus from a JEE perspective, so his dedication was a game-changer for us. Then came the time for the test series. The JEE course I was enrolled in provided a comprehensive test series. I attempted all the tests they offered, which significantly boosted my preparation. The same went for the JEE Advanced papers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Incident(s) happened on the day of  my JEE Advanced exam. My friend and I had arrived at the center by cab. As we got out of the car and started moving towards the main gate, I realized I had forgotten my admit card after walking about 15 steps. I hurried back to the car, but it was locked. I searched for the driver, but he was nowhere to be found. For the next minute, we looked for him in vain. Then my father tried to contact him, but guess what! his phone was inside the car. After 2 minutes, he suddenly appeared out of nowhere (he was taking a piss), and after exchanging some words, I retrieved my admit card. Now I could breathe a sigh of relief, but little did I know what was coming next.

                We got to know that my friend and I were assigned to the same room. Upon reaching the room, there was an identification check of our fingerprints against our Aadhaar cards. When my turn came, they asked me to use my index finger (I didn't know whether it was the left or right hand), but it didn't match. I thought it was normal and would match after a few tries but after trying  around 20-25 fuc*#&ng times with both index and thumb fingers from both hands,  none matched. Worse still, they asked me to wait aside while they verified other students, and I feared I might not be able to take the exam.

                I waited for 10 minutes until there were no other students left to verify. Then they discussed my options, which felt like a life-or-death decision to me. After some consideration, they used the thumb finger of my left foot, and it matched on the first try. It felt like a reprieve from a death sentence. Anyway, after all that ordeal, I had to refocus my mind on the exam. I replayed the song in my mind that I used to listen to all the time, which gave me some confidence. Exam went fairly well. The relief after the exam cann't be written in words....
                <br><br>
                And now, here I am, writing this blog :-)

            <h3>My Journey to IISc</h3>
            <p class="author">Author: Subhadeep Singh </p>
            <p class="posted">Posted: 30 June 2024 </p>
            <p class="content">
                Before class 6th: I studied up to class 5 in a government school. At that time, I was not happy with my school and school life. I always thought about attending a residential school, so I began preparing for the Navodaya Vidyalaya entrance exam. My family's financial condition was not good enough to afford quality coaching for the exam. However, my parents asked my tuition teacher to help me with the entrance exam syllabus, and my tuition teacher accepted the challenge with very low fees. After a year of preparation, I qualified and got a chance to be admitted to Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya Paschim Medinipur.
                <br>
                <br>
                Class 6 to 10: After entering my new school, I was very excited and happy. On the first day, all the other students were crying because they had to live without their parents as it is a residential school. But on the other hand, I was not sad; I was very happy because my dream of living in a hostel was coming true. From class 6 to class 9, my life was full of enjoyment; it was the golden period of my life. In class 10, some selected students from my class got the chance to write a scholarship exam for free JEE and NEET coaching (Dakshana). I also got a chance to write the exam, but my exam was taken in class 11 due to COVID-19. I knew that my family couldn't afford JEE coaching, so this exam was very important to me. After a few weeks, when the result came out, I was the only student in my whole class selected for this scholarship. For coaching, I had to go to JNV Kottayam in Kerala.
                <br>
                <br>
                Class 11 & 12: This was the most hardworking part of my life. After coming to Kerala, I faced many problems like food issues and sleeping problems. After a few months, I adjusted to my situation and gave all my effort to studying. Every day, I had to study continuously and consistently. I stayed in the classroom even after coaching. I returned to the hostel after dinner because I knew I was not a naturally intelligent student, so I had to work harder to compete with others. My daily routine was to go to the classroom at 7 AM, study up to 9 PM, then have breakfast. Our classes started at 9:30 AM and continued until 5:30 PM, with a 45-minute lunch break in between. After classes, I stayed in the classroom until dinner. After dinner, I returned to the hostel and started problem- solving. I went to sleep at midnight. My math was the weakest among all three subjects, so I tried to strengthen my physics and chemistry. In chemistry, my physical chemistry was also weak. In this journey, I constantly faced problems. One of the biggest problems I faced before the first attempt was my breakup with my girlfriend. She left me in December, and my exam was scheduled for January. This time period was very depressing for me, but I had no time to feel sad or depressed about this incident. So, I regularly tried not to remember it and kept myself busy with studying. Despite all my efforts, I couldn't perform academically at the same level as before. I took the first attempt at JEE, and although it was good, I knew I could have done better if this incident hadn't happened in my life. After the first attempt, I had no motivation to continue studying. The board exams were coming soon, but they were easy for me because I had already studied physics, chemistry, and math previously. I only had to prepare for English and Hindi. I studied these two subjects within 2 weeks and got decent marks in the board exams.
                <br>
                <br>
                After the board exams, the second attempt of JEE Mains was coming up, but I had already lost my consistency, so it didn't go well. Then, the JEE Advanced exam was there, but after the first attempt at JEE exams, I lost my consistency, so I didn't get good marks in coaching practice tests. One more reason for my downfall was that I was satisfied with getting into an NIT. One month before JEE Advanced, I tried to restart my preparation. During this time, I realized that if I qualified in math, I would surely get into an IIT. So, I focused on improving my math. After giving the JEE Advanced exam, I felt very happy because, after many days, I got relief.

            <h3>Freshmen college experiences</h3>

                Summer break is going on after an intensive and exhilarating 1st year at IISc. It was a very interesting year in my life, with various new experiences, some fun and some other not so much. Here I attempt to recount the year.
                <br>
                <br>

                Going to study at an university after a long and tense JEE preparation is indeed a very refreshing feeling. I could sense that this was the mood of almost everyone who enrolled in the 2023-24 batch of IISc (barring a few, who were already bracing themselves for the academic year up ahead). To give a timeline to events, the admission formalities were completed on 26th July, and we were expected to stay on campus from 26th. 

                Let me tell you a small story of how we were allotted to our hostel. At IISc, 1st and 2nd year undergraduate students are expected to reside on campus at a hostel block specifically assigned to them, named the E Block. But what had happened a year ago is that the university decided to start offering a 4 year B Tech program in Mathematics and Computing, which basically meant that the total number of undergraduate students entering was going to increase the year before. The intake was greater than the housing capacity of E Block, which meant that some students had to be packed away to other miscellaneous hostels throughout the campus. In our year, we were the (ostensibly unfortunate) ones who were shipped away. As all of this was going on amidst the admission formalities, there were many dissatisfied parents who complained that their wards were being offered (supposedly inferior) rooms in blocks outside of the one where most students would stay. Such was the environment, that even me and my parents were worried for a while. Only later did we come to know that perhaps we were the most fortunate, having been offered single rooms without sharing at perhaps the quietest corners of U Block, with clean toilets and hospitable neighbours.
                <br>
                <br>

                First month into college life is really fun. There are lots of parties being organized all over the place, added to the clamorous atmosphere where everyone tries to make new friends. Two years after living a secluded life during my JEE preparation, I was feeling that I had really turned into an introvert. During school days, I remembered being outspoken and physically fit, but my shape had waxed over the course of the previous two years. Thus, I had two resolves set for myself as I stepped into this new phase. Firstly, I needed to lose some weight, and secondly, I needed to make some new friends.

                My first semester was not very promising in these aspects, as I barely made any proper solid friendships (although I did lose some mass). In those days, I mostly spent time sitting in my room, watching random YouTube videos or binging movies, and whenever time permitted, reading books and articles on a plethora of topics. 

                The real fun I had was in the second semester. My friendships strengthened a lot during this period, and I remember those fun times when I and Vinay went out for late night walks. It was not new for him (he was going on these dates with other people in 1st semester), but it was a refreshing experience for me, strolling aimlessly in the dark streets and chatting about a variety of topics, from politics to philosophy to religion and what not. Sometimes we went to our night canteen at Sarvam, grabbing a bottle of cold drink (and sometimes food). We also had other fun times, such as festivals like holi, as well as various fests and DJ Nights.

                I also volunteered in organizing the main fest which is held at IISc, named Pravega. It was really an eye opening experience for me, and I learned a lot from the exposure. I did all kinds of groundwork, from lifting tables and chairs, to preparing ground plans for the allocation of stalls, to listening to the irritated and indignant vendors who grumbled for their stalls. I remember being so tired after one particular day, that I skipped the program after putting so much effort to organize it. This experience also helped me a lot to know (and get known) a lot of seniors and various other campus staff. 

                I also went out to play sports during my 2nd semester. We went to play football a few times. I also accompanied Vinay to play badminton a few times (although badminton was never my strong suite). However, the sport I played the most number of times was gully cricket. It was a real fun experience. As we had classes and labs most of the times during weekdays, we usually went out to play during midnight. I am not a very good player at cricket (having not played since many years), but it was real fun to rediscover the game. I improved very slowly at batting and bowling, and now I can confidently say that no team I play in would say that it would have had been better if I wasn't in their team (this at least!). Once, I also had a fight with one of my classmates during a game of cricket, but it was resolved soon enough.
                <br>
                <br>

                All this being said, I want to say a few words about the academics at IISc. To speak honestly, perhaps IISc would be one of the few places in India where you would find studious undergrad kids. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that excelling academically at IISc is a real challenge, considering the volume of students here who spend their days and nights only focussing on their academics. I am fortunate in at least one aspect, this being that I have carved a niche for myself in being good at mathematics (although how long the façade would last, I dare not ask). I am good at maths, but other subjects, let's just say that I manage to not disappoint myself. I do good, but not the best. This is what I deserve really, when I spend lots of time apart from academics. 

                Subjects aren't tough here like in class 11th and 12th, but you have to dedicate your hours in studying. Everyone who performs sub-par their expectations knows exactly what they need to do to improve, and most of the times people do do well when the situation demands.

                To close out this little essay, let me add my little bit of philosophy. I think the most important thing to do in college (if you have the resources, financial and mental) is to learn to face the world, all the while exploring your interests. College is a semi safe space where you face the world through a translucent frame, kind of dealing with people but being under the protection of your campus. Do make good use of this kind of setup, it's hard to get it afterwards!
