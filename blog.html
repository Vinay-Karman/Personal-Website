            <h3 >First day at IISc</h3>

                It was on the 5th of July that I set foot on the campus of IISc. We had our counseling scheduled for that day. The weather was cloudy and a bit rainy. My father and I arrived at the campus around 9 o'clock.

                Our first challenge was finding the Sathish Dhawan Auditorium, where the main commencement was going to take place. With some help from the security guards, we finally reached our destination. After completing some paperwork, I entered the auditorium. There, we received a warm welcome from the Director of IISc, followed by speeches from the Dean and various professors. They explained the course structure, often comparing it to that of IIT Bombay.

                After the informative session, we were given a tour of the campus by our seniors. They showed us various departments and the iconic main building. Following the brief tour, we had lunch. The meal was delicious, and I naively thought the mess food would be equally good (I was mistaken).

                After lunch, I roamed around the campus a bit more before we left to catch our train home. During the counseling session, I spoke with some other students.

                The first person I met was Keval Pithadhya from Gujarat. I also met two interesting guys. One was a student from Uttar Pradesh (I forgot his name). In the end, he joined IIT Kanpur. He told me that he had been preparing for JEE Advanced since 6th grade and now just wanted to play Call of Duty. The other was named Vaibhav Mahore. I would describe his personality as a 'blowhard' and a 'narcissist'.

                Afterward, I made many more friends when some guys created a WhatsApp group. This marked the beginning of my journey at IISc, filled with new experiences and connections.

            <h3>My Journey from 10th to 12th: From Average Student to Aspirant</h3>
            <p class="author">Author: Vinay Karman </p>

            <p class="content">
                In April 2021, my parents were searching for a school for my 11th and 12th studies since my previous school only went up to the 10th standard. After some consideration, they decided to enroll me in Career Academy in Nahan, in the Non-Medical stream. When I transitioned from the 10th to the 11th grade, I was an average student academically. You might laugh, but initially, I hadn't even heard about competitive exams like JEE or NEET. All I knew about was the NDA exam. I was so passionate about joining the army that I took the Sainik School exam in the 8th grade and started exercising to get physically fit for the exams. Luckily, my father choose to admit me to the competition batch (for JEE and NEET exams), where I learned about these exams.  When I googled them, my first reaction was, "Who the heck takes these ridiculous tough exams just for college admission?" I thought college admissions were like school admissions EASY!. Never in my wildest dreams did I think about preparing for these exams. But some circumstances led me to start preparing for JEE.

                <br>
                
                When I began my JEE preparation, I was literally 'DUMB'. I didn't even know the discriminant formula and didn't realize it was taught in the 10th standard (I spent the year playing games!). My coaching classes were held online on Teams, making it hard to understand the concepts, and the coaching was terrible except for the math teacher (who I later found out had passed away recently due to cardiac arrest). A friend suggested a YouTube video on differentiation by Alakh Pandey. This introduced me to the open-source way of learning through YouTube. From then on, I watched Physics Wallah (PW) videos to cover theory. That's how I started preparing for JEE. During my prep time, I had my ups and downs, like any other student. I learned physics from YouTube and math from my teacher. However, I struggled with chemistry as I couldn't find any good YouTube teachers for it. As a result, my chemistry was weak in 11th grade. In the blink of an eye, 11th grade was over, and it was time for the final year, 12th standard. I initially thought of leaving the competition program as it was wasting my prep time, but I decided to stay because of the math teacher. I also saw it as a way to stay focused and not get distracted, as I would have to join the standard batch where they taught for boards.

                Starting 12th standard, the coaching teachers weren't taking our classes, and board teachers took over instead. My classmates and I were so furious about this that we united to raise our voices. The situation was so bad that one girl from our batch decided to leave the school after paying the non-refundable fees. After some resistance from our side, they started taking our classes regularly. One thing I forgot to mention was that our coaching offered courses for both NEET and JEE, but our common subject classes were combined. This had its own consequences for both JEE and NEET students. Seeing all this chaos, I purchased the PW Lakshya JEE course and started studying from it regularly. I would go to class at 9 AM, come back home around 2/3 PM, and then start my online lectures from 4 to 9 PM. That was my schedule for 12th standard. Luckily, for chemistry, a teacher named Siddharth Kirti joined the coaching, and he was fabulous. He saved my chemistry from becoming a Titanic disaster. Siddharth sir was so dedicated to teaching us that he even held classes on Sundays at our request. The previous chemistry teacher hadn't completed the syllabus from a JEE perspective, so his dedication was a game-changer for us. Then came the time for the test series. The JEE course I was enrolled in provided a comprehensive test series. I attempted all the tests they offered, which significantly boosted my preparation. The same went for the JEE Advanced papers.
